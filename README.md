# dashdash-code
web app to help you learn morse code!

### description
DashDash Code will help you flex your Morse code memory by providing syllabic mnemonics that are associated with each letter of the alphabet. Before you start, check out the default mnemonics or create ones for yourself! Happy dashing and dotting!

### setting your own mnemonics
These mnemonics are styled such that the syllables in uppercase translate to dashes and those in lowercase translate to dots. For example, "aCHOO" would help you remember that A in Morse code is [dot dash], while "los ANgeles" suggests that L is [dot dash dot dot].
